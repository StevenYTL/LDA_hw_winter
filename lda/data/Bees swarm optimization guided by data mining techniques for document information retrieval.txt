Let D={d1,d2…dm}&lt;math&gt;&lt;mrow is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;D&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;{&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn is="true"&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn is="true"&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;}&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; be the set of m documents and let T={t1,t2…tn}&lt;math&gt;&lt;mrow is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;{&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn is="true"&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn is="true"&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub is="true"&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi is="true"&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo is="true"&gt;}&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; be the set of n terms. Each document is composed of the subset of terms included in T. The user’s request Req is represented by the set of terms. The Document Information Retrieval (DIR) is the process of finding relevant documents, according to the user’s request Req, from a collection of documents D (Salton & McGill, 1986). The classical approach for DIR problem scans all documents and computes the score between each one and the given user’s request. The ranking function is then used to keep only the relevant documents (Salton & McGill, 1986). This process has a polynomial complexity, however, when dealing with a large number of documents, the runtime will be extremely high.

paragraph:2
In the last decade, many data mining based approaches have been used as preprocessing step to solve the IR problem by discovering knowledge from collections of documents. The extracted knowledge is then used for the solving step. Indeed, these approaches split the collection of documents into many groups. After that, the search process is performed on each group using high-performance computing tools. Two main approaches have been proposed. The works reported in Steinbach, Karypis, Kumar et al. (2000), Cai, He, and Han (2005), Hammouda and Kamel (2004), Hatamlou, Abdullah, and Nezamabadi-Pour (2012), Mahdavi and Abolhassani (2009) use the K-means algorithm (MacQueen, 1965) to group the clusters into k disjoints clusters, where each group contains similar documents. Whereas, the works reported in Beil, Ester, and Xu (2002), Fung, Wang, and Ester (2003), Yu, Searsmith, Li, and Han (2004), Menezes et al. (2010) use Frequent Patterns Mining (FPM) (Zaki & Hsiao, 2002) to discover the frequent terms in the collection. Afterward, the top k frequent patterns are used to create the groups of documents. These approaches decompose the initial problem into many subproblems, where each of which could be solved independently. However, the runtime of the DIR problem is still prohibitive, especially when dealing with massive number of documents existing in the World Wide Web (WWW).

paragraph:3
More recently, some bio-inspired approaches have been developed to handle the DIR problem. The evolutionary-based approaches (Benetos, Dixon, Giannoulis, Kirchhoff, & Klapuri, 2013; Blei, 2012; Fan, Gordon, & Pathak, 2004; Lin, Chen, & Wu, 2014) and the swarm intelligence approaches (Buscher, Dengel, Biedert, & Elst, 2012; Collett, Graham, Harris, & Hempel-de Ibarra, 2006; Picard, Revel, & Cord, 2012; Zhang, Mei, Liu, Tao, & Zhou, 2011) proposed in the literature transform the DIR problem into an optimization problem and consider the collection of documents as a space of solutions. The intensification and diversification strategies of these approaches allow finding an approximate subset of documents in a reasonable computational time. Moreover, the communication between the swarms permits to find high-quality solutions compared to the evolutionary ones. Nevertheless, the process is still stochastic, and when the space of solutions is large, the swarms are disoriented, which degrades the quality of the final subset of documents returned by the swarms. Motivated by the success of BSO in dealing with many optimization problems, this paper aims to develop and investigate a new BSO algorithm for solving the DIR problem. The proposed algorithm exploits the information extracted in the pre-processing step by using both clustering and closed frequent itemset mining techniques to guide the swarms in the exploration of the space of documents.

paragraph:4
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
•The proposed approach improves the preprocessing step of existing information retrieval approaches by applying both clustering and closed frequent itemset mining to extract knowledge from a collection of documents. Indeed, the K-means algorithm is first applied to generate k clusters; then FPM is performed on each cluster to extract the frequent patterns between highly correlated documents. To reduce the dimensionality of the frequent patterns, the closed algorithm (Lucchese, Orlando, & Perego, 2006) is used to extract only the most frequent patterns.•Two bees swarm optimization algorithms are proposed by developing different heuristics which allow the swarms to well explore the search space. During the search process, the bees are guided by the knowledge extracted in the preprocessing step.•To validate the runtime performance and the quality of returned documents, extensive experiments have been done on medium, large and big collections. The results show that our approach outperforms the data mining based approach when using large collections. Moreover, it outperforms the bio-inspired and other document information retrieval based approaches in terms of solution’s quality using big collections and it is very competitive to them regarding the runtime process.

Title:Bees swarm optimization guided by data mining techniques for document information retrieval

Abstract:This paper explores advances in the data mining field to solve the fundamental Document Information Retrieval problem. In the proposed approach, useful knowledge is first discovered by using data mining techniques, then swarms use this knowledge to explore the whole space of documents intelligently. We have investigated two data mining techniques in the preprocessing step. The first one aims to split the collection of documents into similar clusters by using the K-means algorithm, while the second one extracts the most closed frequent terms on each cluster already created using the DCI_Closed algorithm. For the solving step, BSO (Bees Swarm Optimization) is used to explore the cluster of documents deeply. The proposed approach has been evaluated on well-known collections such as CACM (Collection of ACM), TREC (Text REtrieval Conference), Webdocs, and Wikilinks, and it has been compared to state-of-the-art data mining, bio-inspired and other documents information retrieval based approaches. The results show that the proposed approach improves the quality of returned documents considerably, with a competitive computational time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
